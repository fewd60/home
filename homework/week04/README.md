# Final Project - first steps

Refine your concept for what your project will be. Create a written description of what you want to build (a paragraph) and a wireframe of the page. For inspiration on what you might build, look at [past FEWD projects](https://gallery.generalassemb.ly/FEWD) or [this site inspiration page](https://www.siteinspire.com/).

To build a wireframe, you can hand draw it, or use a tool like [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) or [sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/).
